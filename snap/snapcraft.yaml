summary: Diode relay node
description: |
  The Diode Network is a decentralized permissionless ZTNA network allowing 
  any device in the network to communicate with any other device in the network
  through always end-to-end encrypted channels. Hosting a Diode relay node extends
  the network and is rewarded when the new diode relay node is used by other devices. 

grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
confinement: devmode # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots
